EasyLiPo Android app : manage your batteries with NFC !

EasyLiPo helps hobbyists to manage all the batteries they have by simply adding NFC tags to them (it's optional) and scan them every time they use them. 

The app synchronizes all the data across your devices and helps you keeping track of the state of all your batteries (number of cycles, state of charge).
